# ODSC-Lander-Learning-2017

RMarkdown files from two workshop sessions with [Jared Lander](https://www.jaredlander.com/) at ODSC East 2017.
This was a phenomenal session that covered the basics of statistical modeling. 

Jared taught two workshops: Statistical Modeling in R & Intro to Machine Learning.

Topics:


## Statistical Modeling
  - Measures of central tendency & summary statistics
  - Handling missing data
  - T-tests
  - Formula Interface
  - Linear Regression
    - Logit
    - Poisson
    - Quasipoisson
  - Generalized Linear Models
  - Coefficient plotting & interpretation
  - The wonders of `model.matrix()`: dummy variables & interactions

## Machine Learning
  - Penalized Regression
  - Elastic Net (`glmnet()`)
    - Lasso & Ridge
  - Decision Trees
    - Basic decision trees
    - `rpart()`
    - Tree plotting
  - Boosted Trees
    - `xgboost()`
    - Importance
  - Clustering
    - K-means
      - Gap statistics
    - K-meanoids (pam)
    - Hierarchical
